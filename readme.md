Bull Note
===================================

This is a simple note taking app for Android. As much as possible, it adheres
to Android's best practices, including defining database constants in a Contract
class, implementing the framework classes ContentProvider and SQLiteOpenHelper
to interact with the database, performing database operations on a
background thread using a Loader, and populating the ListView of notes with
an Adapter that recycles views when they leave the screen.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v15 and above (i.e. Ice Cream Sandwich - present)
